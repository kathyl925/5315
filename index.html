      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. A container is a lightweight, stand-alone package of a software that includes everything needed to run it such as code configurations, system tools and settings. 
This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developer’s personal laptop.
Containerization provides a clean separation of concerns, as developers focus on their application logic and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and management without bothering with application details such as specific software versions and configurations specific to the app.
Containers are often compared with virtual machines (VMs). VMs is a guest operating system such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with virtualized access to the underlying hardware. Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments for running your software services.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is a high performance, highly scalable, highly available web server, reverse proxy server, and web accelerator (combining the features of an HTTP load balancer, content cache, and more). NGINX offers a highly scalable architecture that is very different from that of Apache (and many other open source and commercial products in the same category). NGINX has a modular, event driven, asynchronous, single-threaded architecture that scales extremely well on generic server hardware and across multi-processor systems. NGINX uses all of the underlying power of modern operating systems like Linux to optimize the usage of memory, CPU, and network, and extract the maximum performance out of a physical or virtual server.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>A cloud service provider, or CSP, is a company that offers some component of cloud computing, typically infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS), to other businesses or individuals.
In the IaaS model, the cloud service provider delivers infrastructure components that would otherwise exist in an on-premises data center. These components could consist of servers, storage and networking as well as the virtualization layer, which the IaaS provider hosts in its own data center. 
DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. DigitalOcean is a very popular with open source developers and competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Engine.
